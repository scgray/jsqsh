This directory contains the SQSH JNI layer that provides some native
calls necessary to propery spawn external processes and allow those
processes to retain control of the console.  This layer should compile
on most UNIX platforms as well as Win32 platforms.

Building: UNIX
==============

The compile for UNIX is pretty straight forward:

   $ ./configure
   $ make

After it is finished you will find the JNI shared library located
in the .libs directory.  At this point I usually just pick up the
library and copy it where I need it.

Building: Windows
=================

I couldn't quite get the GNU autoconf stuff to work properly here, however
I've been working with 'cmake' at my main job for a while now, and kind of
like it, so I have developed a 'cmake' project for this.  You don't really
need to know anything about cmake, but you do need to install it. It can
get it from here: http://www.cmake.org

Once installed, you just need to do:

   c:\jsqsh> cd src\jni
   c:\jsqsh\src\jni> cmake -G "NMake Makefiles"
   c:\jsqsh\src\jni> nmake

CMake is a build system builder. That is, it doesn't actually do the build, 
but produces files for your build-system of choice for it to work. So,
the above will build Makefiles suitable for 'NMake', but you can also
have it generate visual studio projects. eclipse projects, etc.
