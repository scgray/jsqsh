   The ${font} variable specifies the name of the font that will be

VARIABLE
   prompt - Defines the query prompt.

DESCRIPTION
   The ${prompt} variable defines the prompt that will be displayed before
   each line of input. Unlike other variables, this variable may, itself,
   contain variables that will be expanded prior to display.
   
   For example, the default value:
   
      #if($connected==true)[$server][$user] #end$lineno>
      
   will show:
   
      1>
      
   when not connected to a server and:
   
      [prod-db][sa] 1> 
      
   when connected (the #if/#end syntax is part of Velocity, the tool
   that is used to expand variables. Documentation is available from
   http://velocity.apache.org/engine/releases/velocity-1.5/user-guide.html).
   
   Care must be taken when setting this variable to ensure that the
   varables are not expanded when it is being set. For example:
   
      1> \set prompt="$lineno>"
      
   will have the $lineno expanded at the time the prompt is set and
   is exactly identical to:
   
      1> \set prompt="1>"
      
   which clearly isn't what you inteded. Instead use single quotes:
   
      1> \set prompt='$lineno>'

VARIABLE
   terminator - Defines the SQL statement terminator.

DESCRIPTION
   The ${terminator} variable defines a single character that can be used
   to terminate a SQL statement or block and cause it to be executed without
   having to issue a '\go', for example:
   
       1> select * from sysobjects;
       
   will directly execute the query because ';' is the current terminator.
   
   \unset'ing this variable disables the in-line query terminator feature
   and requires that you explicitly issue a '\go' to execute your queries.
   
   Be very careful choosing an alternative terminator, since you don't
   want to be inadvertantly executing queries.

COMMAND TERMINATOR
   As of jsqsh 1.5, the terminator may also be used to terminate a line
   with a jsqsh command. For example, if ";" is the current terminator
   then you can type:
   
      1> \echo hello how are you;
      hello how are you
   
   and the terminator will be silently ignored. If any input follows 
   the terminator, an error will be issued:
   
      1> \echo hello; there
      Input is not allowed after the command terminator ";"

		<Description>Displays the readline implementation in use</Description>
        <Help><![CDATA[
VARIABLE
   readline - Displays the readline implementation in use.

DESCRIPTION
   The read-only ${readline} variable displays the mechanism that is
   being used to read input. 
   
   JSqsh is written in Java and java provides no easy mechanism to 
   work with the console for activities such as editing the current 
   line, or scrolling forward and backward through history or performing
   command-line completion.  As a result, JSqsh relies upon some 3rd
   party libraries to assist in these activities, some of which are
   actual native code rather than Java code. 
   
   Upon start up, JSqsh goes through some logic to determine which
   libraries are available on your platform and it chooses the first
   available that it can successfully utilize in the following order:
   
   readline - This is an interface to the GNU readline API. This
              library provides full command line editing and completion
              plus has configurable key-bindings and modes for those 
              that prefer different configurations. Documentation
              for configuring is available from:
                 http://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html
   editline - This is an interface to the NetBSD editline library.
              This library is very similar in functionality to GNU
              Readline. Documentation for configuring is available
              from: 
              	 http://linux.die.net/man/5/editrc
   jline    - On UNIX JLine is a pure java library, on windows it
              requires a small DLL to function.  It provides command
              line editing and completion, but is not as flexible in
              the key bindings (e.g. it provides no 'vi' bindings).
              Documentation for JLine is available from:
                 http://jline.sourceforge.net/
   getline  - Getline is used primarily on Windows and provides 
              basic command line editing, but no completion functionality. 
   purejava - This is the most basic interface and provides no editing
              or completion functionality.
   
   Although it is not possible to change the readline library at run-time,
   you may force the library to be used with with the "--readline" command
   line option to jsqsh or by setting the JSQSH_READLINE environment variable.
   Both methods may be provided one of the names above.

VARIABLE
   maxrows_method - Controls the mechanism used to limit result set rows

DESCRIPTION
   The ${maxrows_method} variable is used to control the mechanism that is
   used to limit result rows as specified by the ${maxrows} variable. This
   variable may be one of the following:
   
     discard   (Default) This causes jsqsh to silently discard all rows
               beyond ${maxrows}. This is the safest and recommended 
               mechanism to utilize but can cause delays as additional
               network traffic as the rows are processed.
     
     cancel    This causes jsqsh to issue a cancel to stop the processing
               of the query when ${maxrows} is reached. This can cause 
               side effects because it cancels the entire query, not just
               the current result set. For example, if you were calling
               a stored procedure or a SQL batch that contained multiple
               statements or queries, the cancel would stop the processing
               at the first query that returned more than ${maxrows}.
    
     driver    This causes jsqsh to ask the JDBC driver to limit row
               results to ${maxrows} (via the drivers Statement.setMaxRows() 
               method). This method has been shown to have side effects in
               some drivers of not just limiting the result rows but also
               limiting UPDATEs and DELETEs to ${maxrows}.

   JDBC drivers can be found on your system. The path is specified
   as a delimited list of ".jar" files or directories containing ".jar"
   files.  The delimiter is ";" on Windows or ":" on UNIX.  The following
   is an example of a valid UNIX classpath:
   
      /home/gray/jars/sybase.jar:/home/gray/drivers/
      
   where the first entry is an explicitly specified jar file ("sybase.jar")
   and the second entry is the path to a directory that contains multiple
   jars, each of which will become part of the classpath.

DESCRIPTION
   The ${headers} variable can be used to turn on or off the display of
   column header information in query results.  The default value is "true".

   footers - Controls the display of query footer information
   
DESCRIPTION
   The ${footers} variable can be used to turn on or off the display of
   query footer information in query results. Footer information includes
   the row count, update count, and query timing that is normally displayed
   after each result set is displayed. The default value is "true".

   echo - Controls echoing of input to stdout 
   
DESCRIPTION
   If set to "true" the ${echo} variable causes every line that is read
   as input to be echoed back out to output. The typical use of this is
   when running jsqsh non-interactively with a script. With this option on,
   you will see all of the SQL and commands as well as the output of all of
   the commands.

VARIABLE
   perfect_sample_rows - Controls the display of query footer information
   
DESCRIPTION
   The ${perfect_sample_rows} determines the number of rows that are 
   sampled (held in memory) by perfect result renderers (such as used 
   by the "perfect" display style) before results are displayed.  The
   larger this number, the better the results will be rendered, however
   the more memory will be consumed as all the rows must be held in memory
   before display.
   
   A value less than 1 indicates that all rows will be sampled prior to
   display.  The default value is 500.

   show_stack - Controls whether or not stack traces are display from exceptions

DESCRIPTION
   The ${show_stack} boolean variable controls whether or not exceptions
   thrown during the execution of a command (such as "\go") will display
   just the text of the exception or the full stack trace.  The default 
   is "false", limiting the output to just the text of the exception.
   This is typically only set to true if you need to debug a problem within
   a driver or possibly a specific command.
   
   Currently not all places that deal with exceptions in jsqsh honor this
   setting.
