   rc - The return value of the last executed command

DESCRIPTION
   Each jsqsh command that is executed, such as "go" (\go) returns a 
   success (0) or failure (not-zero) indicator. This return value can be
   accessed via the ${rc} variable.
   
   Each time a command fails, the ${fail_count} session variable is 
   automatically incremented. When jsqsh exits, the exit code is determined 
   by adding together the value of ${fail_count} across all sessions
   that were executed within jsqsh. That is, if the total is 0, then jsqsh
   exits with 0, otherwise the exit code indicates the number of failures
   encountered during its execution.

        <Help><![CDATA[
VARIABLE
   exec_mode - Controls the manner in which SQL execution is performed.

DESCRIPTION
   By default JSqsh sends SQL to the remote database server in "immediate"
   mode (for those of you savvy with Java, it is Connection.execute(...)),
   which means that the server just takes the SQL, parses, and runs it. 
   For certain database platforms, however, certain types of statements cannot
   be run in immediate mode.  For example DB2 z/OS cannot execute a procedure
   call ("CALL procname") in immediate mode--the SQL must first be prepared
   (It's silly, and I don't know why).

   This variable switches the mode in which JSqsh sends SQL to the remote
   server.  It may be set to either 'immediate' or 'prepare'. 

   It is rare that you should ever need to change this variable. Most
   driver definitions in jsqsh will automatically set this to the correct
   value when you connect to the server.

   The ${show_stack} boolean variable controls whether or not exceptions
