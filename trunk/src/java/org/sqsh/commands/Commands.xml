SYNOPSIS
   \drivers
              
DESCRIPTION
   Displays a list of drivers that are currently registered with
   jsqsh. An asterisk (*) will be displayed next to drivers for
   which the actual JDBC implementation (.jar file) is available.

   JSqsh comes bundled with one JDBC driver (jtds) which should
   be sufficient to communicate with Microsoft SQL Server or Sybase
   ASE. Additional drivers can be made available in one of three ways:
   
   1. Setting the ${classpath} jsqsh variable to a location containing
      JDBC jar(s) for the driver(s) you want (see '\help classpath').
   
   2. Making sure the driver is  contained in your CLASSPATH environment
      variable, e.g., for UNIX or cygwin:

        $ CLASSPATH=/path/to/some/jdbc/driver.jar:"$CLASSPATH"
        $ export CLASSPATH

     or, for Windows:
   
        C:\> set CLASSPATH=/path/to/some/jdbc/driver.jar; %CLASSPATH%
        
   3. Alternatively, you can add a JDBC driver implementation to jsqsh's
      startup jar directory. The path to this directory can vary from
      platform to platform but can typically be found in one of the
      following locations relative to where the jsqsh binary is located:

         ../lib
         ../share
         ../share/jsqsh

DRIVER DEFINITION FILE
   JSqsh comes with a bunch of pre-defined driver definitions built-in,
   however you can provide your own additional definitions if you wish
   by editing the $HOME/.jsqsh/drivers.xml. This file contains lots
   of comments describing the structure of the file.

           Establishes a connection to a database.
        ]]></Description>
            <Help><![CDATA[
SYNOPSIS
  \connect [options] [jdbc-url]
              
DESCRIPTION
  The \connect command attempts to establish a JDBC connection
  to a database server.  If a connection is successfully 
  established then the connection becomes the active connection
  for the current session. If the session already had a connection
  established, then the existing connection is closed and replaced
  with the new connection.
              
  The JDBC URL that is used to connect can be supplied 
  explicitly via either via the "jdbc-url" argument or a 
  driver definition name can be provided ("driver-name") that
  will provide the URL (to see a list of available drivers
  use the \drivers command).
  
OPTIONS
  Each JDBC driver shown by the \drivers command references a 
  number of variables in its JDBC URL. For example, the Oracle
  driver's URL looks like:
  
      jdbc:oracle:thin:@${server}:${port}:${SID}
   
  The majority of the options shown below set the value of one
  of these variables. For example, the "-S" flag sets the value
  of the ${server} variable.
   
  -d driver   The name of the jsqsh driver definition that will
              be used for the connection (use \drivers to see
              a list).
              
  -S server   Sets the value of ${server}
                         
  -p port     Sets the ${port} property. This typically defines
              the listening port of the server you wish to 
              connect to. Most drivers will provide a default
              value for this property if it is not supplied.
                          
  -D database Sets the ${db} property. This will cause 
              the database context to be set to the provided
              database following connection to the server (in 
              the JDBC world the database context is known as 
              the "catalog"). Not all drivers support this behavior.
                          
  -U username Sets the ${user} property that determines the 
              username that will be utilized to connect to the
              database.
                          
  -P password Sets the ${password} property that will be used
              to authenticate with the server.
                          
  -s SID      Sets the ${SID} property, and provides the Oracle 
              SID that will be used when connecting to Oracle.
               
  -c class    When utilizing a direct JDBC url (and not a jsqsh
              driver definition), this should be utilized to
              define which JDBC driver class will be utilized
              for the connection.
                          
   -n         Create a new session for this connect without
              closing the connection in the current session.
              
   -w domain  For Windows based authentication, sets the ${domain} 
              property, specifying the windows domain to be utilized
              when establishing the connection. Not all JDBC drivers
              support this functionality.
                          
   jdbc-url   An explicit JDBC url to be utilized for the 
              connection. In most cases it will be necessary
              to provide the implementing JDBC class name 
              with the -c flag when providing an explicit URL.

DEFAULT VALUES
   For any of the variables set by options described in the OPTIONS 
   section, above, you may provide a default for that variable by
   prefixing the variable name with "dflt_" in your session. For example:
   
      \set dflt_port=5555
      
   would cause default value of ${port} to be 5555 unless the -p option
   is provided to override that value.

VARIABLES SET
   After a connection is successfully established, the variables described
   in the OPTIONS section will be available privately to your session. 
   Thus, the variable $port would expand to be the port that was used
   when connecting to your session.

DESCRIPTION
   The \buf-edit command is used to edit the contents of a SQL buffer

   using the variable ${EDITOR} or ${VISUAL}. If neither of these variables
   is defined, then an appropriate text editor is chosen based upon the
   operating system in which jsqsh is executing. Specifically, windows
   platforms will attempt to execute 'notepad.exe' while other platforms
   will attempt to run 'vi'.
 
ALIASES 
   By default the \buf-edit command is aliased to 'vi' and 'emacs'.
           
OPTIONS
   src-buf   Indicates which buffer should be edited. If no src-buf is 
             provided, then the current buffer will be edited (!.). If the
             current buffer is empty, then the previous buffer will be used.
             
   dst-buf   Indicates in which buffer the edited SQL should be placed. If
             no destination is provided then the current buffer (!.) is chosen.

           Creates an alias
        ]]></Description>
           
        <Help><![CDATA[
SYNOPSIS
   \alias [-G] [name=text]
              
DESCRIPTION
   An alias in jsqsh is slightly different (and potentially more dangerous
   if misused) than the UNIX shell equivalent. In jsqsh, an alias defines a 
   piece of text that, when encountered in a user's input, is replaced with
   another piece of text. 
   
   In its simplest form, it is typically used to allow you to rename commands
   so that you can refer to them the way you want to. For example:
   
       1> \alias exit='\quit'
       
   will allow you to type:
   
       1> exit
       
   to quit jsqsh (note single quotes around the '\quit'. The single quotes
   prevent jsqsh from trying to interpret and remove the back-slash).
   
   Another common use of \alias may be to provide pre-argumented commands.
   For example:
   
      1> \alias '\prod'='\connect -U sa -S prod-db -d mssql-jtds'
      
   will allow you to later connect to the production database with:
   
      1> \prod-db
      Password: 
      
   And, now for the dangerous part. Under normal circumstances aliases only
   apply to the first word encountered on an input line. That is, with
   the input:
   
      1> \alias one=1
      1> select 'one';
   
   the results of the select statement would be the word 'one'. However,
   supplying the '-g' flag to alias causes the word to be replace ANYWHERE
   it appears in the line of input. so:
   
     1> \alias -g one=1
     1> select 'one';
     
   would return a result set with '1' in it. 
   
   Why is this so dangerous? Well, it means that you can do silly things
   like:
   
     1> \alias select='shutdown with no wait select'
     
   I'll leave it as an excersize for the reader to figure out what this
   would do (although it would only be effective on Sybase or MSSQL).
     
OPTIONS
   -G      Causes an alias to be applied globally to a line, anywhere the
           name of the alias appears. Without this flag, the alias will
           only apply if it is the first word on the line.

SYNOPSIS
   \procs [-p proc_pattern] [-s schema_pattern]
              
DESCRIPTION
   Displays information about procedures that are available within the 
   current database (catalog). This function requires that the JDBC 
   driver  support meta-data lookup functionality, which not all 
   drivers support (although most do).
   
OPTIONS
   -p proc_pattern  - A SQL pattern to be used to filter the set of object
        names that are displayed.
   -s schema_pattern - A SQL pattern to be used to filter the set of object
        schema names that are displayed. For most databases, the "schema
        name" refers to the name of the owner of the object.

        <Help><![CDATA[
SYNOPSIS
   \macro
              
DESCRIPTION
   This \macro command takes the current buffer that you are typing into
   and runs it through the Velocity engine, with the primary purpose of 
   allowing you to define re-usable macros (velocimacros).
   
   By way of example:
   
      1> #macro (prod $tab)
      2> use $tab
      3> #end
      4> \macro
      Ok.
      1> #u('master')
      2> \go
      
   We have defined a macro called #u() that takes the name of a database
   and expands to be  "use" command on that database (granted, this is a
   pretty worthless example, but you get the idea).

DESCRIPTION
   The \diff command executes the current SQL buffer in the current

   compares the results to determine if they are identical.
   
   The comparison includes:
   
   * Exceptions thrown must be identical

   * Values in rows must be identical
   
OPTIONS
   -e N  Specifies the stringency level to be used when comparing

   -u N  Specifies the stringency level to be used when comparing
         the update counts (the "rows affected") returned between results. 
            0 - Update counts are not compared

SYNOPSIS
   \insert [-b batch_size] [-s session_id] table_name
              
DESCRIPTION
   The \insert command executes the current SQL buffer and turns any
   result sets that are returned by the query into SQL INSERT statements.
   This is similar to executing the \go command with  its "-i" option, 
   except that a more fine grained control of how the inserts are processed
   is available.
   
   By default, \insert simply displays the INSERT statement(s) to the 
   screen, however if the -s flag is provided a connection maintained
   by a different session may be used to execute the INSERT statements.
   
OPTIONS
   -b batch_size  Specifies the number of rows that should be "batched"
                  together. If the "-s" option is not used, then this
                  indicates how often a "go" is displayed to the screen.
                  If the "-s" option is used, then the specified number of
                  INSERT statements is executed at once, followed by a 
                  commit.
                  
   -s session_id  Provides a target session id for execution of the 
                  INSERT statements that are generated.  The provided
                  session must be connected to a database server to
                  function.

        <Description>Generates a SELECT using table definitions</Description>
           
        <Help><![CDATA[
SYNOPSIS
   \select [-p] [-n] table_name [table_name ...]
              
DESCRIPTION
   The \select command generates a SELECT statement based upon the
   set of tables provided as an argument.
   
   If more than one table is provided to \select, then an appropriate
   WHERE clause will attempt to be generated to join the tables together.
   If the -n flag is provided, then the WHERE clause will be the "natural
   join" of the tables--that is, all columns of the same name and type 
   will be joined together.  If the -n flag is not provided, then the join
   will be created by analyzing the foreign key/primary key relationships
   between the tables. 
   
   The \select command requires proper meta-data support from the underlying
   JDBC driver and may not work properly for all driver implementations.
   
OPTIONS
   -n  Cause the join clause that is produced to be based upon the "natural
       join" of the columns in the tables. The natural join attempts to join
       all columns of the same name and datatype.
       
   -p  Causes the SELECT statement to just be printed to the screen rather
       than placing it into the SQL buffer for execution.

        <Help><![CDATA[
SYNOPSIS
   \create [-p] table_name
              
DESCRIPTION
   The \create command generates a CREATE TABLE statement based upon the
   name of the table provided on the command line.
   
   The definition of the table is determined by asking the JDBC driver
   for metadata information about the table, so the CREATE statement will
   only be as accurate as the driver reports. In addition, the current
   implementation of the \create command does not include anything other than
   column names, types, and nullability.  That is, it does not include any
   primary or foreign key information or check constraints.

SYNOPSIS
   \call [arg ...]
              
DESCRIPTION
   The \call command is similar to the \go command except that the SQL
   contained the the SQL buffer is treated as a callable statement and
   the arguments passed to \call are treated as the arguments to the callable
   statement.
   
   As an example:
   
      1> select * from sysobjects where name = ?
      2> \call syscolumns

TYPED PARAMETERS
   For most platforms, the parameters passed to a prepared statement must
   be of the appropriate datatype for the query. For these cases, the \call
   command allows a datatype prefix for the arguments provided. These
   prefixes are:
   
      S:<value>   Specifies a string value
      C:<value>   Specifies a character value
      Z:<value>   Specifies a boolean value
      D:<value>   Specifies a double value
      I:<value>   Specifies an integer value
      J:<value>   Specifies a long (64 bit integer) value
      
   for example:
   
      1> select * from sysobjects where id = ?
      2> \call I:1234
