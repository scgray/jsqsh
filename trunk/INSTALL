                           Building JSqsh
                      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Compiling
=========

As an end-user I'm hoping that you won't need to read this section, as 
I will try to keep pre-compiled distributions available at:

   http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=205193

However, I will need help maintaining current builds for various
platforms, so please feel free to donate builds.

Requirements
------------

To build jsqsh you'll need the following:

   1. Sun Java >= 1.5 JDK (http://java.sun.com)
   2. Ant >= 1.6 (http://ant.apache.org/)

The following are required if you wish to build sqsh's JNI layer. For
the windows platforms the dll's are packaged in the dist/win32 and dist/win64
directories, so there is not need to build them unless you make changes.

Unix
   1. gcc >= 3.x
   2. gnu make >= 3.x

Windows
   1. cmake
   2. Visual Studio 2005 or later

Java
----

To build the core jsqsh java code is easy:

   $ ant jar

This should leave you with a file called build/jsqsh-<version>.jar. Having
this jar, plus all of the jars in lib/ is sufficient to run jsqsh. 

You can also directly run jsqsh from the build tree by doing:

   $ ant run

Note that the JNI layer will not be available when running in this mode.

JNI Code
--------

On all UNIX/POSIX platforms compiling the JNI layer _should_ be as easy
as doing:

   $ cd src/jni
   $ ./configure
   $ ./make

after this process completes you should find the resulting shared library
in src/jni/.libs/libjsqsh.so.

For Windows, you need to have cmake installed on your system. Once installed
you should be able to do:

   C:\jsqsh> cd src\jni
   C:\jsqsh\src\jni> cmake -G "NMake Makefiles"
   C:\jsqsh\src\jni> nmake

Note that cmake is also capable of producing a visual studio project file
if you would rather.  Refer to the cmake documentation.

Distributing
============

Distributions are packages that can be easily installed on a particular 
platform (e.g. .rpm, .deb, .zip, etc.). The following distributioning
schemes are currently available:

Platform Indepentant (.zip)
---------------------------
The ant task 'dist' creates a distribution that is platform independant
(and thus does not include any of the jsqsh JNI layer components). 

   $ ant dist

This should leave you with a file called build/jsqsh-<version>.zip.
When unpacked the zip file should include:

   jsqsh-<version>/
       bin/jsqsh      - Shell scrip to launch jsqsh
       share/*.jar    - Jars required to execute jsqsh

Debian/Ubuntu (.deb)
--------------------
The ant task 'dist-deb' builds a Debian install package:

   $ ant dist-deb

This should leave you with a file called build/jsqsh-<version>.deb
after it completes. 

Please note that this task requires that you have everything required
to build the jsqsh JNI layer as it will attempt to build and package
the shared library as well.

RPM (.rpm)
--------------------
The ant task 'dist-rpm' builds an RPM distribution.

   $ ant dist-rpm

This should leave you with a file called build/jsqsh-<version>.rpm
after it completes. 

Please note that this task requires that you have everything required
to build the jsqsh JNI layer as it will attempt to build and package
the shared library as well.

It is important to note that I haven't really gotten this build task
down very well -- it seems to work OK on some distributions and not
others. RPM's are kind of complex, nasty, beasts, so I would love
some help in making this process work better if anyone out there has time.

Windows (.zip)
--------------
The ant task 'dist-win32' or 'dist-win64' builds a distribution suitable 
for running on Microsoft Windows (XP or later). This task requires that 
you have Launch4j installed on your system (http://launch4j.sourceforge.net).

To build the distribution, execute:

  $ ant -Dlaunch4j.dir="C:/Program Files/Lunch4j" dist-win32

(replace the path to Launch4j as appropriate for your system).
