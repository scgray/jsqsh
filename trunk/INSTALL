                           Building JSqsh
                      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Compiling
=========

As an end-user I'm hoping that you won't need to read this section, as 
I will try to keep pre-compiled distributions available at:

   http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=205193

However, I will need help maintaining current builds for various
platforms, so please feel free to donate builds.

Requirements
------------

To build jsqsh you'll need the following:

   1. Sun Java >= 1.5 JDK (http://java.sun.com)
   2. Maven 3.x

The following are required if you wish to build sqsh's JNI layer. For
the windows platforms the dll's are packaged in the dist/win32 and dist/win64
directories, so there is not need to build them unless you make changes.

Unix
   1. gcc >= 3.x
   2. gnu make >= 3.x

Windows
   1. cmake
   2. Visual Studio 2005 or later


Build Targets and Configurations
--------------------------------

The jsqsh build uses maven, so follows the basic maven development lifecycle:

  mvn compile    # compiles the code
  mvn package    # produces a package. By default this a .jar file in target/
  mvn clean      # cleans up after a build

You can enable jsqsh to also compile its JNI layer using -Djni=true, like so

  mvn -Djni=true compile
    or
  mvn -Djni=true package

Finally, you can adjust which kind of package is produce by the build with:

  mvn -P [rpm|deb|tgz] package

When done in the above manner, you'll get files like:

  target/**/jsqsh-<version>-noarch.<type>

however, if you include JNI compilation, like so:

  mvn -P [rpm|deb|tgz] -Djni=true package

You'll wind up with something like

  target/**/jsqsh-<version>-<arch>.<type>

JNI Code
--------

On all UNIX/POSIX platforms compiling the JNI layer _should_ be as easy
as doing:

   $ cd src/jni
   $ ./configure
   $ ./make

after this process completes you should find the resulting shared library
in src/jni/.libs/libjsqsh.so.

For Windows, you need to have cmake installed on your system. Once installed
you should be able to do:

   C:\jsqsh> cd src\jni
   C:\jsqsh\src\jni> cmake -G "NMake Makefiles"
   C:\jsqsh\src\jni> nmake

Note that cmake is also capable of producing a visual studio project file
if you would rather.  Refer to the cmake documentation.
