The following is an informal TODO list for jsqsh:

- Create a "bestfit" display style that will attempt to fit the results to
  the console window size.
- Fix
    select * from db..table where <tab>
  this should list columns in table but doesn't yet.
- Fix -w flag to \connect
- Add flag to go to suppress headers/footers
- Make csv style automagically supress footers
