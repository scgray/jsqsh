The following is an informal TODO list for jsqsh:

- Implement tab completions for object names
- Create \macro command treating the current buffer as if it was full
  of velocimacros. That is, don't execute the SQL, but run it through the
  velocity engine so that the user can build up a library of useful 
  velocitimacros.
- Create .rpm distribution
