This directory contains support files for distributing jsqsh 
on a Windows platform.  There are a couple of notes here:

jsqsh.dll - This is here for convenience. It should be
  a copy of the latest output from building src/jni, but if you
  are unsure you can always go build your own version.

JavaGetline.dll - This DLL implements the Java Readline JNI
  interface (http://java-readline.sourceforge.net/). Please note
  that the JavaGetline.dll that comes with the java-readline
  distribution didn't work for me, so I had to compile it myself
  using cygwin. I compiled it using:

   #!/bin/sh
   JDK="/cygdrive/c/Program Files/Java/jdk1.5.0_12"

   WIN32=MSC
   export WIN32

   gcc -mno-cygwin -I"$JDK/include" -I"$JDK/include/win32" \
       -Wl,--add-stdcall-alias -shared  \
       -DMSC -DJavaGetline -D__IBMC__ -g \
       -o JavaGetline.dll *.c

 This script should be run in the src/native directory that
 comes with the java-readline distribution.
