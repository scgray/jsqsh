Release 0.9.6
* Fixed bug #1816504 - Queries returning multiple result sets were getting
  fouled.

Release 0.9.5
* Dramatically improved tab completion. It is now contextual to your position
  within the SQL statement being written. If the FROM clause has been written
  or the target of the INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE has been specified, then the
  completion will restrict itself to that context. This was more difficult
  than I expected!
* Added $headers and $footers configuration variables to control display
  of result header/footer information
* Added -h and -f to the \go command to toggle the display of result 
  header and footer information respectively.
* Added "-w domain" flag to \connect so that domain based authentication
  can be used when connecting. Currently only the mssql-jtds driver 
  recognizes this option. 
* Added \eval command to read and process the contents of a file.
* Added tab completion of procedure names.
* Added handling/display of SQL warnings.
* Improved formatting of error messages.
* Added testing of JVM support for catching CTRL-C. If it is not supported
  (i.e. the gcj JVM), then a warning message is issued.
* Added support for gij (gcj's JVM) 1.5.0
* Added default aliases "vi" and "emacs" or \buf-edit
* Removed 'csv' display of footer information (rowcounts).
* By default the \history command will now only show the first 10 lines of 
  any SQL statement. The -a flag has been added to allow you to see the 
  complete statements if you want.
* Fixed OutOfMemoryError when nested SQL exceptions are returned by the server.
* Fixed NullPointerException when running non-interactive scripts
  of SQL via the -i flag.

Release 0.9.4

* Added tab completion of object names. The logic is pretty smart too, and
  understands "quoted object names" and [bracketed object names].
* Added '-m style' flag to the \go command.
* Added new display style 'csv'.
* Added new ${classpath} configuration variable to allow the user to
  specify additional jar locations for JDBC drivers.
* Added support for empty passwords
* Added new \macro command for defining velocimacros
* Fixed documentation for the \connect command
* Fixed "-D" flag for the \connect command
* Fixed handling of NULL values for binary data types.

Release 0.9.3

* Initial release. Seems stable enough (I use it every day), but
  warrants some shakedown before 1.0 release
