Release 1.3-SNAPSHOT
* Compilation requires JDK 1.6 now due to support for new datatypes. It
  should run OK in JDK 1.5 provided you don't reference one of those
  datatypes.
* A driver definition (the drivers.xml) file may now contain a new
  <Property> tag to define properties that are to be passed into the
  driver at connect time.
* The DB2 driver now sets the retrieveMessagesFromServerOnGetMessage 
  property. This results in actual usable error messages.
* The \call statement is now capable of displaying Oracle result sets
  produced from Oracle refcursors. This is done with the special ":r"
  argument placeholder.  See "\help call" for details.
* The "perfect" display mode will now attempt to compact the display columns
  sufficiently tight to fit within the screen (only if jsqsh JNI is 
  available).
* Added mssql2k5 driver definition for the SQL Server 2005 JDBC
  driver.
* History buffer numbers are now numbered oldest to newest, so that 
  the buffer number for a given buffer will not change until the 
  session ends or the buffer is removed from history.
* Added --repeat to \go, so that a query can be executed multiple times.
  During this execution the variable ${iteration} can be referred to
  within the query to determine which iteration of the repeat cycle
  the query is on (starting from 0).
* Added display style of "discard" that discards all rows. This is useful
  for performance testing.
* Added ${scale} and changed the definition of ${precision}. These
  two values now work together when displaying floating point
  values exactly as one would expect them to.
* Added ${querytime} configuration property to suppress display of
  query timing information. 
* Added dist-sparc-sol build target. This provides a .tar.gz file
  that contains jsqsh and its JNI files. Currently this relies upon
  the build platform having readline-5.x installed
* Added support for SQLXML datatype
* Enabled support for "N" types, NVARCHAR(), NCHAR(), etc. 
* Fixed recognition of Oracle NUMBER type when it is not qualified with
  a specific precision and scale.
* Fixed case where stored procedures with multiple result sets would
  occasionally not show all of the available result sets. Unfortunately,
  this problem still persists in the SQL Server 2005 driver, but I think
  its a bug in the driver.
* Fixed persistence of the SID attribute of a connection to the 
  connections.xml file. 
* Fixed NullPointerException when maxrows_method=driver 
* Fixed $user not being set when the username is provided at the 
  "Username:" prompt rather than on the command line.

Release 1.2
* Added new mechanism to \connect to allow a logical name to be assigned
  to a connection and persistently saved away so that the connection
  can be re-established in the future using only the name. This provides
  a cleaner mechanism for managing connections than the 'alias' command.
  Run  "\help connect" for more details.
* Added session-to-session redirection, allowing the output of a 
  command executed in one session to be executed by another session
  (or even re-executed by itself).  See '\help redirection' for details.
* The \call command can now iterate through a CSV file and execute a
  prepared statement once for each line in the file, using the fields
  in the file as arguments to the procedure.
* Fixed handling of "bit" datatypes.
* Fixed ^C handling that I broke the last release.
* Fixed the \eval command aborting when it executes a command that
  causes a session switch, such as \session or \connect -n.
* Fixed "\connect -c" not finding classes that are specified in the
  ${classpath} jsqsh variable.
* Fixed OutOfMemoryError when processing the results of a backtick
  expression (e.g. \set x=`echo 1234`)

Release 1.1
* Changed several aspects of command line options:
     - All jsqsh options have a long form and a short form 
       (e.g. -h and --help).
     - You no longer need a space following an option (e.g. 
       "-U sa" and "-Usa" are equivalent).
     - Every jsqsh command accepts -h and --help to cause a usage
       of the command to be dumped.
     - Every jsqsh command accepts -g and --gui to cause its output
       to be sent to a graphical popup window.
     - The new help topic "options" discusses this.
* Added new display style "graphical" that will pop open a GUI window
  containing query results in a sortable graphical table.
* Added $window_size to control the size of the window in graphical
  display mode and $font to set the font that will be used.
* Added $nocount variable to turn off the display of rowcounts generated
  due to update/delete statements.
* Added \insert command, this displays the results of the current SQL
  query as INSERT statements or executes the INSERT statements in 
  another session.
* Added \select command to generate select statements and joins from
  table definitions.
* Added \create command to generate CREATE TABLE statement from a table
  definition.
* Added \diff command to compare results from SQL executed across 
  multiple session.
* Added \call command to execute a prepared statement. This command
  is primarily for debugging purposes.
* The \help command is now more organized.
* JSqsh is now better at determining if the session is interactive
  or non-interactive (i.e. if stdin has been redirected).
* Tab completion now recognizes the TSQL "use" statement.
* Display of "info" type SQLWarning's (e.g. the output from a "print"
  statement from Sybase and Microsoft) is improved.
* Fixed the -i flag causing jsqsh to exit if the script contained
  a \connect -n.
* Fixed failure when trying to format Oracle TIMESTAMP columns for
  display.
* Fixed \connect command trying to use settings from the current session
  when trying to connect. Read the \connect command for details.
* Fixed bug in PL/SQL parser that cause jsqsh to sit in tight loop
  eating CPU when parsing certain PL/SQL blocks.
* Fixed bug with way getUpdateCount() is being called that was causing
  Sybase's jConnect driver to complain.
* Updated driver definition to use the jConnect 6.x driver for Sybase
  
Release 1.0
* Tab completion now recognizes stored procedure execution requests and
  will attempt to complete parameter names and procedure names.
* Added '-i' flag to GO to allow you to generate INSERT statements from a 
  result set.
* Added support for CLOB and BLOB datatypes (bug #1820183). Current support
  requires holding the entire object in memory so be careful!
* Added $show_meta variable to display JDBC result set metadata as a separate
  result set when executing queries.
* Added $maxrows_method variable that is used to control the mechanism that
  jsqsh uses to limit row results. This added because I discovered that 
  setting the row limit in some JDBC drivers caused unwanted side effects.
* Added \procs command to display list of procedures in the current database.
* Added PL/SQL analyzer so that semicolon termination can be used against
  Oracle. 
* Added \debug command to turn on debugging for specific classes.
* The \describe command will now describe stored procedure parameters.
* Improved formatting of number datatypes (tinyint, int, short, bigint,
  float, double, etc.) to minimize the amount of space required for display
  wherever possible.
* Fixed the driver definition for the DB2 JDBC driver.
* Commands that edit or alter the current SQL buffer will also affect the
  readline history as if the user had just typed in the buffer. E.g. if you
  hit '!3' at the prompt to re-load the third oldest query, the readline
  history will look as if you just typed that query. 
* Fixed bug #1816504 - Queries returning multiple result sets were getting
  fouled.
* Fixed bug #1820182 - Handling of Oracle NUMBER columns failing during
  formatting. 

Release 0.9.5
* Dramatically improved tab completion. It is now contextual to your position
  within the SQL statement being written. If the FROM clause has been written
  or the target of the INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE has been specified, then the
  completion will restrict itself to that context. This was more difficult
  than I expected!
* Added $headers and $footers configuration variables to control display
  of result header/footer information
* Added -h and -f to the \go command to toggle the display of result 
  header and footer information respectively.
* Added "-w domain" flag to \connect so that domain based authentication
  can be used when connecting. Currently only the mssql-jtds driver 
  recognizes this option. 
* Added \eval command to read and process the contents of a file.
* Added tab completion of procedure names.
* Added handling/display of SQL warnings.
* Improved formatting of error messages.
* Added testing of JVM support for catching CTRL-C. If it is not supported
  (i.e. the gcj JVM), then a warning message is issued.
* Added support for gij (gcj's JVM) 1.5.0
* Added default aliases "vi" and "emacs" or \buf-edit
* Removed 'csv' display of footer information (rowcounts).
* By default the \history command will now only show the first 10 lines of 
  any SQL statement. The -a flag has been added to allow you to see the 
  complete statements if you want.
* Fixed OutOfMemoryError when nested SQL exceptions are returned by the server.
* Fixed NullPointerException when running non-interactive scripts
  of SQL via the -i flag.

Release 0.9.4

* Added tab completion of object names. The logic is pretty smart too, and
  understands "quoted object names" and [bracketed object names].
* Added '-m style' flag to the \go command.
* Added new display style 'csv'.
* Added new ${classpath} configuration variable to allow the user to
  specify additional jar locations for JDBC drivers.
* Added support for empty passwords
* Added new \macro command for defining velocimacros
* Fixed documentation for the \connect command
* Fixed "-D" flag for the \connect command
* Fixed handling of NULL values for binary data types.

Release 0.9.3

* Initial release. Seems stable enough (I use it every day), but
  warrants some shakedown before 1.0 release
