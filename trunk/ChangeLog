Release 0.9.4

* Added '-m style' flag to the \go command.
* Added new display style 'csv'.
* Added new ${classpath} configuration variable to allow the user to
  specify additional jar locations for JDBC drivers.
* Fixed documentation for the \connect command

Release 0.9.3

* Initial release. Seems stable enough (I use it every day), but
  warrants some shakedown before 1.0 release
