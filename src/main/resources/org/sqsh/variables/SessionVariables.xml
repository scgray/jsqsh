        <Description>Controls the output display style</Description>
        <Help><![CDATA[
VARIABLE
   style - Controls the output display style.
   
DESCRIPTION
   The '$style' variable can be set to switch how jsqsh displays its results
   to the user.  This variable is a little different from most jsqsh variables,
   please read the NOTES section, below carefully.

SQL STYLES
   The following styles may be set for a SQL (JDBC) session established
   using \connect, or may be set when no session has been started.
   
   csv     - Displays the output as a set of comma separated values suitable
        for loading into, say, Excel. The results displayed attempts to 
        conform to: http://www.creativyst.com/Doc/Articles/CSV/CSV01.htm.
        Here are some things you should be aware of, though:
        
        - Unless headers are suppressed with the ${headers} variable or
          via the --no-headers (-H) option to \go, the first row in the
          file will contain the column headers.
        - A NULL value is represented by a completely empty field.
        - A zero-length string is represented by "" in order to differentiate
          it from NULL.
        - A field will be quoted with double-quotes if the value contains:
             - A double quote (which will be escaped with as "").
             - Leading or trailing white space
             - A comma
             - A newline

   discard  - This causes all rows to be retrieved from the query but to
        be discarded (i.e. not displayed). This is primarily useful only
        for timing queries that return rows where you want to discount 
        (most of) the overhead of actually displaying the rows.  It is 
        important to note that jsqsh will still fetch the row and format
        the columns into strings for display so there is still that overhead
        involved in the process.
        
   graphical - Displays the results in a graphical window (GUI). This will
        only work on environments where the graphical interface is 
        available to the JVM. 
        
        Note: the variable ${window_size} can be used to control the size
        of the window that is opened to display results.
   
   graph    - A synonym for "graphical".     
   
   isql     - This formats its output in a fashion similar to that of Sybase's
        (or Microsoft SQL Server's) 'isql' program.
        
   json     - Displays results as an array of JSON records (http://json.org).
   
   perfect  - This is the default display style and is very similar to how
        tools like the mySQL client display their output. The output is 
        contained in a text-based grid, like so:
              
           +----------+----------+
           | COLUMN 1 | COLUMN 2 |
           +----------+----------+
           |     1234 | hello    |
           +----------+----------+
              
        The 'perfect' display style is so-called because it holds rows 
        in memory prior to display, then analyzes the maximum amount of
        data to be displayed in each column and attempts to adjust the
        display accordingly so that as much data as possible fits cleanly
        on the display. To avoid consuming too much memory, the variable 
        ${perfect_sample_rows} is used to determine how many rows are 
        sampled before the display  process begins--after which point 
        no more rows are held in memory and results are streamed to the
        display as they arrive. For example:
        
            \set perfect_sample_rows=20
            
        indicates that the first 20 rows of the results will be held in
        memory for analysis before display begins. Setting this variable
        to a value less than one will cause all rows to be sampled.
   
   pretty   - This is visually identical to 'perfect' except that it does not
        attempt to perform a perfect fit on the data before display and,
        thus, does not need to hold the results in memory during display.
        Use this style when you need to work with very large result sets.
   
   vertical - The vert (or vertical) style rotates the output, so that every 
        line is represented by a column name followed by a column value. This 
        is nice for looking at particularly wide output.
   
   vert     - A synonym for "vertical".
   
   tree     - Displays the results in a graphical window (GUI).  Just like 
        graphical except it  displays the resuts in a tree syle format. 

        Note: the variable ${window_size} can be used to control the size
        of the window that is opened to display results.
   delimiter- same as delim
   delim    - Just like csv except you can customize the output by setting 
        aliases for the parameters.

        delimiter - the string to set to separate values default ,
        marker - the string to set to wrap values default "
        newline - the string to set to indicate new line default \n
        escape - the string to set to indicate an escape sequence for a 
                 marker.  Default is double the marker.
            
NOTES
   This variable is a little odd in that it has slightly different
   behavior in different contexts:
   
      * If no session/connection is established, then the style name provided
        must be a valid SQL display style.
      * If a session is established, then the style name must be a valid
        display style for that type of session.
   
   This means that you cannot use ${style} to set the display style of a non-
   SQL session type before the session is started, and when the session ends
   the value of ${style} will revert to the current SQL display style.

        <Description>Return value of the last executed command</Description>
        <Help><![CDATA[
VARIABLE
   rc - The return value of the last executed command

DESCRIPTION
   Each jsqsh command that is executed, such as "go" (\go) returns a 
   success (0) or failure (not-zero) indicator. This return value can be
   accessed via the ${rc} variable.
   
   Each time a command fails, the ${fail_count} session variable is

   by adding together the value of ${fail_count} across all sessions
   that were executed within jsqsh. That is, if the total is 0, then jsqsh
   exits with 0, otherwise the exit code indicates the number of failures

   exec_mode - Controls the manner in which SQL execution is performed.

DESCRIPTION
   By default JSqsh sends SQL to the remote database server in "immediate"
   mode (for those of you savvy with Java, it is Connection.execute(...)),
   which means that the server just takes the SQL, parses, and runs it. 
   For certain database platforms, however, certain types of statements cannot
   be run in immediate mode.  For example DB2 z/OS cannot execute a procedure
   call ("CALL procname") in immediate mode--the SQL must first be prepared
   (It's silly, and I don't know why).

   This variable switches the mode in which JSqsh sends SQL to the remote
   server.  It may be set to either 'immediate' or 'prepare'. 

   It is rare that you should ever need to change this variable. Most
   driver definitions in jsqsh will automatically set this to the correct
   value when you connect to the server.

DESCRIPTION
   This option is provided primarily to support buggy drivers.  Certain JDBC
