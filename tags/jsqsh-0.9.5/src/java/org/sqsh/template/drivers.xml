     == Each driver entry looks like the one below (note, this one is
     == commented out). The attributes supported are:
     ==
     == name     - This is the name that the driver needs to be referred to
     ==            when it is utilized (e.g. supplied to sqsh's -d flag).
     == target   - This is a string that just documents what platform the
     ==            driver is ment to be used for (e.g. "Oracle").
     == class    - The JDBC driver class name to be utilized
     == analyzer - (optional) This is the name of a java class that 
     ==            implements the SQL code analysis logic for sqsh. At the
     ==            moment this analysis is used only for determining when
     ==            the SQL terminator (';') applies. For example, in Oracle
     ==            a semicolon can also be used as a statement terminator
     ==            in a block of PL/SQL so that analyzer for Oracle will 
     ==            attempt take this into account.
     ==
     ==            Supported analyzer classes are:
     == 
     ==            org.sqsh.analyzers.TSQLAnalyzer - Used for Sybase ASE and
     ==               Microsoft SQL Server. The terminator will be ignored
     ==               when contained in double-quotes, single quotes, 
     ==               comments, or between BEGIN/END blocks.
     ==            org.sqsh.analyzers.ANSIAnalyzer - A generic analyzer
     ==               that ignores terminator contained in double-quotes,
     ==               single quotes, or comments. This is the default if
     ==               none is supplied.
     ==
     == url      - This is a JDBC URL template that will be utilized when
     ==            establishing a connection. This template may refer to
     ==            any sqsh variable value or variable in the <Variable/>
     ==            declarations below (if the user does not set the variable
     ==            then the value found in the <Variable/> declaration will
     ==            be used instead. The sqsh command line and the \connect
     ==            command set the following variables via command line
     ==            flags:
     ==            
     ==              -U     Sets $user
     ==              -P     Sets $password
     ==              -S     Sets $server
     ==              -p     Sets $port
     ==              -s     Sets $SID
