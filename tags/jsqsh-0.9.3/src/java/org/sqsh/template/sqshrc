## sqshrc - Sqsh initialization file
##
## This file is ready by sqsh upon startup and is executed exactly like
## the sqsh command line. That is, you can do anything you want in it
## that you could do on the command line, including connect to the database,
## run queries, etc. Typically, its primary use to to set configuration
## variables.
##
## As you may have noticed, comments are indicated by a leading '##' on the
## line. These *must* be the first two characters if they are to be comments,
## otherwise they are left in place.
##
## Here are some sample settings that I like to use:
##
## \set EDITOR=/usr/bin/vi
## \set terminator=';'
## \set prompt='#if($connected==true)[$server][$user] #end$lineno>'
## \set driver=mssql-jtds
