This directory contains the SQSH JNI layer that provides some native
calls necessary to propery spawn external processes and allow those
processes to retain control of the console.  This layer should compile
on most UNIX platforms as well as Win32 platforms.

Building: UNIX
==============

The compile for UNIX is pretty straight forward:

   $ ./configure
   $ make

After it is finished you will find the JNI shared library located
in the .libs directory.  At this point I usually just pick up the
library and copy it where I need it.

Building: Windows
=================

I couldn't quite get the GNU autoconf stuff to work properly here
so you can't just run 'configure' like above. For this you will need:

   - Cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com)
   - The gcc-core cygwin package
   - The gcc-mingw-core package

At this point you should be able to generate the DLL from a cygwin
bash shell by running:

   $ ./Windows_Make.sh

from this directory. When complete this should leave you with a 
file called 'jsqsh.dll' in this directory, which you can pick up and
do as you will.
