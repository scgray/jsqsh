The following is an informal TODO list for jsqsh:

- Create an org.sqsh.SQLAnalyzer for Oracle so that semicolon can 
  properly be used as a terminator (I'm not a PL/SQL guy, so I could
  use some help with this one).
- Allow an internal sqsh CLASSPATH environment variable so that making
  JDBC jars available is easier.
- Create .rpm distribution
