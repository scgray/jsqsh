What is JSqsh?
==============

JSqsh (pronounced jay-skwish) is a Java re-implementation of a tool that
I originally authored called sqsh (http://sourceforge.net/projects/sqsh/).
The original sqsh was a Sybase-specific console based tool (i.e.
non-graphical) that combined the ability to query the database with 
much of the functionality of a shell, such as piping the results of
queries out to external programs (grep, more, etc.), expanding variables,
redirecting output to files, command line editing, etc.

Jsqsh attempts to re-create the most frequently used features found in sqsh
but, with the use of JDBC (Java's database driver architecture), allow
it to be used against any database that provides a good JDBC driver.

It is important to note that jsqsh is _not_ a perfect recreation of sqsh,
so please do not blindly run scripts explicitly build for sqsh against
jsqsh without some thorough testing!

Availability
============

The latest release of JSqsh may be found at:

   http://sourceforge.net/projects/jsqsh

99.9% Pure
==========

The core of jsqsh is 100% Java, meaning that it should compile on virtually
any platform that Java runs on.  However, there are two features of jsqsh
that are provided via an additional (optional) layer that is written in C.
These features are:

  - Command line editing (a.k.a "readline")
  - Execution of external programs that require terminal control

The second bullet means that without the C layer, programs that jsqsh spawns
that need to control the terminal (such as a text editor) or query the 
teriminal's size (such as 'more') will not function properly.

Licensing
=========

JSqsh is held under the GNU General Public License (GPL). The details
